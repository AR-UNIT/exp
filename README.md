 - this repo is not solving a critical problem
 - not even really computer science
 - but:
   -   it aims to make runninng benchmarking/scripting sessions less painstaking by providing an orchestration layer on your local machine, to build your code on remote, trigger it via scripts, monitor triggered jobs, record the run metadata, and copy and store resultant outputs locally after jobs finish
